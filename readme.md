# Morti-OS Relationship Trained Communication (RTC) Module
The RTC Module is used by Morti as its main method of communication with the User. The goal of the RTC Module is to process User inputs, and define the context of said input, while calculating an emotional value (1-10) to the expression given.

```
[Example]

You: Hello Morti, today was a bad day

Morti: why was it a bad day?

You: my car broke down in the highway!

Morti: well that sounds frustrating 
// Morti Understands that a personal Item was damaged
````

## Emotional quantification
Morti is planned to have a vast array of emotional responses. Although the amount of emotional responses are limited to Six Primary Emotions, Morti can calculate multiple emotions to get acheive Secondary Emotional responses. (See Image Below)
Each word in the Input Phrase is seperated from the whole, given a corresponding Emotional Weight, and is then its averaged out to find the phrases Emotional Score.

## What is Morti-OS

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morti stands for Machine Operated Relationship Trained Input-Output System. Morti-OS is an Artificially Intelligent Companion, he was built for the purpose of exploring and researching the evolution of information and how its processed, in order to get a better understanding of how the human brain has evolved.

## How will he work

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morti is planned to be made up from multiple Lobes. These Lobes are modeled after the human brain and is split up into Four Parts: Frontal Lobe. Parietal Lobe, Temporal Lobe and Occipital Lobe. Each Lobe has multiple modules contained inside it. Modules act as different sections to Mortis Brain, one such module is the ETC (Emotionally Trained Communication) Module. this module is made up of other smaller components, that allow Morti to efectivly communicate though Web or Applicaiton Interface.
